### My Process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt the way SVG can be used and also It was fascinating to get started with some javascript properties in the project, and i hope to be best at it.

i want to focus more on js, media query, and css animations.
