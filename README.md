## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt the way SVG can be used considering the understanding of viewBox and viewPort. Also It was fascinating to get started with javascript properties in the project, and i hope to fully utilize it in my project and to be best at it  . 

### Challenges
I encountered challenges with the use of SVG and also with the implementation of stacked carousel using vanilla JavaScript.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on js, media query, and css animations.

### Useful resourses
